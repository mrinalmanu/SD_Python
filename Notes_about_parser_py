This one is was only working for:

PDOC00145

(?<=Consensus pattern:)(.*)(?!-Sequence)
works for some other PDOC id's

How to know if there is a general way of extracting information about the Consensus pattern.

I need to extract everything between Consensus pattern: and -Sequences known

Sample text:

_a C-terminal zinc ribbon domain (see ). As a signature pattern for
these subunits, we selected the region that contains the zinc finger.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-C-x-[DEKSTG]-C-[GNK]-[DNSA]-[LIVMHG]-[LIVM]-x(8,14)-
C-x(1,2)-C
[The four C's are putative zinc ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: December 2004 / Pattern and text revised._

Finally, I switced used a third party tool SMS2 to find the active sites based on text alignment.
